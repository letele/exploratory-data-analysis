# Exploratory Data Analysis
John W. Tukey, an influential statistician of the twentieth century, defined data analysis as:<br>
"Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."

This repository aims at defining key concepts of exploratory data analysis using two notebooks:
## 1. data_variables
- Defines terms used in data analysis.
- Explores data variables and their characteristics.
- Explores graphical representations of data variables.

## 2. descriptive_statistics
- Describes statistical terms used to summarize  data sets
- Explores graphical representations of locations and dispersions of data variables.

## Python
Analysis of data variables are done using Python. Specifically using the following packages,
- Numpy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- openpyxl

### Python setup for local environment
1. If not installed download and install python 3.7 or greater 
2. If not installed go to terminal and run: ```pip install pipenv```
3. Clone this repo in terminal and cd into it then run:
    1. ```pipenv shell``` 
    2. ```pipenv install```
    3. ```jupyter lab```: This will open a tab that shows localhost:8888 where notebooks can be opened
